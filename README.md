# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I use node and express to create controllers and routes to handle incoming requests. Mongodb and mongoose are used to create and maintain the database.

User authentication is handled using json web tokens, and passwords are hashed using bcrypt. Deleting items is limited to users' own cards and protected by authentication

You can find the project at secowtwr.csproject.org
